### General Notes on Rust

* You cannot assign twice to an immutable variable (`let`)
* Rust has four primary scalar types: `integers`, `floating-point numbers`, `Booleans`, and `characters`
* Signed integer  variants-(2^[n-1]) to 2^[n-1] - 1 inclusive
* Unsigned integer variants can store numbers from 0 to 2^[n-1]
